This project is built to run on IntelliJ, and utilizes the following software:

1) Spark, for processing http requests
2) Maven, for project organization

IntelliJ may be downloaded from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

This project may then be directly implemented by opening the 'main' folder in IntelliJ. for the sake of convention, this folder should be moved to the /IdeaProjects directory that IntelliJ should have installed on the /user directory.

This folder should also contain display.py, a simple script that launches a command line demonstration.
