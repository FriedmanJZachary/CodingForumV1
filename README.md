#Coding Forum

NOTE: THIS PROJECT HAS SINCE BEEN MOVED, AND MAY BE FOUND AT:
https://github.com/jkurian49/LusterCode/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/cooper/ee/ece366/LusterCode

This project is an online coding forum and interview prepearation tool. It is built to run on IntelliJ and utilizes the following software:

1) Spark, for processing http requests
2) Maven, for project organization
3) MySQL, for database managements
4) VanillaJS, for frontend development

IntelliJ may be downloaded from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

This project may then be directly implemented by opening the 'main' folder in IntelliJ. for the sake of convention, this folder should be moved to the /IdeaProjects directory that IntelliJ should have installed on the /user directory.

This folder should also contain display.py, a simple script that launches a command line demonstration.
